SmoothiePanel is an Open Source Hardware integrated PanelMax. The goal is to bring a 20x4 Character Display with RGB Backlight, RGB illuminated click-encoder, and illuminated Play and Back buttons down to a single I2C port. The basic interface panel supports an illuminated pause button, an illuminated back button, an RGB Click Encoder, a Wii Nunchuck, and lots of extra io!
It is intended to control a Smoothieboard ( GPL too ... http://github.com/arthurwolf/SmoothieBoard ) though could easily be connected to any system with available I2C.

It is based around the PCA9505 port expander and the PCA9634 led controller.
