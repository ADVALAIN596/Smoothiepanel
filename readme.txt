SmoothiePanel is an Open Source Hardware control interface for industrial robotic machinery. It adds a screen and user interface to allow easy control of a Smoothieboard. The current design brings a graphic LCD with RGB Backlight and changeable interface panel down to a port, optionally SPI, UART, or USB.

It is intended to control a Smoothieboard (http://smoothieware.org/), though could easily be connected to almost any logic control system. The firmware found in the firmware directory makes Smoothiepanel behave as a simple slave device that can be used via SPI, UART, or USB. As it is completely open source, however, it is very easy to write custom firmware that takes more advantage of its powerful 50MHz processor and 16 bits worth of extra gpio.

The latest version, Prototype 3, is based around the NXP LPC11UxxFBD64, which sports a 50MHz ARM Cortex-M0 processor with built in USB and up to 128KB of flash.
